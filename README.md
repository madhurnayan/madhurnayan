I am Urologic Oncologist and Assistant Professor at NYU Langone Health. I have passion for improving cancer patients' lives through data-driven research.

During my residency at the University of Toronto, I was part of the Surgeon Scientist Training Program and completed a PhD in Clinical Epidemiology and Health Care Research. 
I built on this foundation in my first year of fellowship in Urologic Oncology at Harvard by taking "Machine Learning for Healthcare" at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In my second year of fellowship, I was invited to be a co-instructor for the same class.

I strongly believe in knowledge sharing. With this in mind, I built https://www.urologyschool.com as a platform directed at learners in Urology. This github is also built with the aim of sharing code and developing collaboratings worldwide, with the ultimate goal of improving cancer patients lives.
